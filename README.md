# discord-music-helpers
A fork of mindaugaskasp/discord-helpers, but it uses streams (instead of caching in disk). Very WIP and Buggy.
I'm rewriting some classes to allow it to use streams (instad of downloading the video, which takes a lot of time.)
I'm creating this as a separate project to try to give it better visibility, and make updates faster, since I plan to add lots of useful features, while maintaining API compatibility.
## Am I allowed to do so?
According to the MIT license, yes I am. If you think I'm wrong, please open an issue.
